- arXiv: In-memory multiplication engine with SOT-MRAM based stochastic computing

```bash
Abstract: Processing-in-memory (PIM) turns out to be a promising solution to breakthrough the memory wall and the power wall. While prior PIM designs yield successful implemen- tation of bitwise Boolean logic operations locally in memory, it is difficult to accomplish the multiplication (MUL) instruction in a fast and efficient manner. In this paper, we propose a new stochastic computing (SC) design to perform MUL with in-memory operations. Instead of using the stochastic number generators (SNGs), we harness the inherent stochasticity in the memory write behavior of the magnetic random access memory (MRAM). Each memory bit serves as an SC engine, performs MUL on operands in the form of write voltage pulses, and stores the MUL outcome in-situ. The proposed design provides up to 4x improvement in performance compared with conversational SC approaches, and achieves 18x speedup over implementing MUL with only in-memory bitwise Boolean logic operations.

# Foobar

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install foobar
```

## Usage

```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
